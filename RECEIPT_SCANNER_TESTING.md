# Receipt Scanner Feature Testing

## Overview
The receipt scanner feature has been successfully implemented with client-side OCR processing using Tesseract.js. No backend server is required for receipt processing.

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Components
- **ReceiptScanner.tsx**: Modal component with camera and file upload
- **ReceiptScanner.css**: Styling for the scanner interface
- **receiptService.ts**: Client-side OCR processing, Supabase integration, and fallback logic
- **supabaseReceiptService.ts**: Dedicated Supabase service for receipt storage
- **ExpenseForm.tsx**: Integration with existing expense form and receipt linking

### Services
- **Client-side OCR**: Tesseract.js OCR processing in the browser
- **Supabase Storage**: Receipt image storage with user-specific folders
- **Supabase Database**: Receipt metadata and extracted data storage
- **Supabase RLS**: Row-level security for user data isolation
- **Category Matching**: Smart category detection against database categories with keyword fallback

### Features Implemented
1. **Camera Access**: Take photos using device camera (mobile/desktop)
2. **File Upload**: Upload receipt images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, PDF)
3. **Client-side OCR**: Tesseract.js for text extraction in the browser
4. **Smart Data Extraction**: Automatic parsing of:
   - Amount (currency symbols, totals)
   - Date (various date formats)
   - Vendor/merchant name
   - Category (matched against database categories with intelligent keyword fallback)
5. **Supabase Integration**: 
   - Receipt image storage in Supabase Storage
   - Receipt metadata saved to Supabase database
   - Automatic linking to expenses when created
   - User-specific data isolation with RLS
6. **Fallback Handling**: Manual entry when OCR fails or user is offline
7. **Data Validation**: Confidence scoring for extracted data
8. **User Corrections**: Edit extracted data before saving
9. **Receipt History**: View all saved receipts for logged-in users
10. **Offline Support**: Receipt processing and storage when offline using localStorage
11. **Data Synchronization**: Automatic sync of offline receipts when going online

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
npm run dev  # Starts frontend only (5173) - no backend needed
```

### 2. Test the Backend
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
# Should return: {"status":"OK","timestamp":"..."}
```

### 3. Test Receipt Scanning in UI
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Navigate to expense form
3. Click "üì∑ Scan Receipt" button
4. Either:
   - Click "üì∑ Take Photo" to use camera
   - Click "üìÅ Upload Image" to select file
5. Review extracted data
6. Edit if necessary
7. Click "Use This Data" to populate expense form

### 4. Expected Behavior
- **Logged-in users**: Receipt images saved to Supabase Storage, metadata in database
- **Anonymous/offline users**: Receipt images and data saved to localStorage with base64 encoding
- **Successful scan**: Extracts amount, description, category, date
- **Failed scan**: Shows manual entry form with prefilled date
- **No backend**: Graceful fallback to manual entry
- **Invalid file**: Error message and retry option
- **Receipt linking**: Automatic association with created expenses
- **Sync behavior**: When going from offline to online, receipts automatically sync to Supabase

## Supabase Setup

### Required Database Migration
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- See supabase_receipts_migration.sql for complete schema
```

### Storage Configuration
1. Create `receipt-images` bucket in Supabase Storage
2. Enable public access for receipt viewing
3. Configure RLS policies for user data isolation

## API Testing with curl

### Valid image upload:
```bash
curl -X POST -F "receipt=@path/to/receipt.jpg" http://localhost:3001/api/receipt/scan
```

### Invalid file type:
```bash
curl -X POST -F "receipt=@README.md" http://localhost:3001/api/receipt/scan
# Returns 400 error with file type validation message
```

## Known Limitations
1. OCR accuracy depends on image quality and receipt format
2. Date parsing may not work for all date formats
3. Category detection is keyword-based (can be improved)
4. Requires good lighting for camera captures
5. Offline receipts stored as base64 in localStorage (limited by browser storage)
6. Large receipt images may impact localStorage capacity

## Sync Testing

### Test Offline‚ÜíOnline Receipt Sync
1. Start in offline mode (no internet or logged out)
2. Scan multiple receipts and create expenses
3. Go online and log in
4. Use the sync feature - receipts should upload to Supabase
5. Verify receipts appear in receipt history
6. Check that expenses are properly linked to receipts

## Category Matching System

The receipt scanner now includes intelligent category matching:

1. **Database Categories**: First tries to match against your existing expense categories
2. **Keyword Mapping**: Uses predefined keywords for common categories
3. **Fallback System**: Defaults to "Other" if no match is found
4. **Real-time Sync**: Fetches latest categories from database for accurate matching

### Supported Category Keywords:
- **Food & Dining**: restaurant, cafe, coffee, pizza, burger, food, kitchen, diner, bistro
- **Transportation**: gas, fuel, uber, taxi, parking, metro, bus, train
- **Shopping**: store, mall, shop, market, retail
- **Entertainment**: movie, cinema, theater, game, entertainment
- **Healthcare**: pharmacy, hospital, clinic, medical, doctor
- **Utilities**: electric, water, internet, phone, utility
- **Groceries**: grocery, supermarket, market, food store
- **Housing**: rent, mortgage, housing, apartment

## Future Improvements
1. Integration with cloud OCR services (Google Vision, AWS Textract)
2. Machine learning for better category detection
3. Receipt template recognition for common store formats
4. Batch processing for multiple receipts
5. Advanced keyword learning from user corrections
